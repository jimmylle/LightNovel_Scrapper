1.1
Now using a BakaTsuki api to get the info. 
Also created a GUI to help but it's not finished.

Right now it only works with hardcoded urls.
Scrapes the main text of the chapter and writes to a .doc file.
Might Add API later so can choose which Light Novel to scrape.
Only works with html where main body text is within span tags.
